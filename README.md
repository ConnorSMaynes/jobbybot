# Jobbybot
Automatically apply to jobs using your own filters. 

#### Supported Job Sites:
> Indeed (UP)

> Ziprecruiter (UP)

> RIT Jobzone (DOWN)

## How To Use / Setup
1. Download this zip file, extract it, and then put it somewhere you won't delete it accidentally.

2. Open the jobbybot folder and click the "Jobbybot.bat" file to run the program.

3. Fill in the job profile information on the right-hand side. Be sure to add the paths to your resume, cover letter, and supporting docs ( put these docs in a permanent location on your computer ), by double-clicking on those lines of the job profile section. Tune your job profile information, so that the jobs matchup section just below yields the kinds of jobs you are looking for.

4. Create an account with at least one of the supported job sites that is marked "UP". Enter your login credentials into Jobbybot and click the "->" button to validate and save these to the local database the program keeps on your computer.

5. Select the job site account you want to start applying to and then click the PLAY button. A browser will flash on the screen and then hide itself, but you will still see the icon on the taskbar (please do not touch this browser, as the program uses this to apply to jobs).

You should now be all setup. Just leave the program open and, hopefully, it will keep running.

All information is stored locally by the program and is as secure as your computer is.
